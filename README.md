# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-LSTM-that-Detect-Adversarial-Attack-using-NSL-KDD-dataset

## Description
Deep learning demonstrates tremendous potential in the
security area, especially in the field of network intrusion
detection system (NIDS). NIDS is designed to detect malicious
behaviors inside an organizationâ€™s network. A functional
NIDS analyzes and raises alarms for the network traffic
entering or exiting the network.

## What does it do?

The LSTM has been trained to detect abnormal behaviors
in the network and to effectively detect adversarial examples
